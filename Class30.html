//As we have already used how to learn different kind of events using onclick, onkeydown, onmouseover, ect. as
// over there we used to create a function seperately and quality using onclick ect.
//There is another alternate way to use these events instead of creating the function seperately we can directly
//cerate it inside an event.
//  We create a button where on the click of the button a popup will appear
//Method one: in this we create a function seperatly and then call it on the button

function hello(){
window.alert("My name is Hana")
}

// Meathod two: In this we use add event listener
//add event listner helps you put a function and event together.
//the benefit of the 2nd method is how we dont need to call it like the firest method
let p=document.querySelector("#c")
p.addEventListener("click",function(){
window.alert("My name is Hana")
})
//html dom functions
//hierarchy (the family tree) of html
//html tag is the parent tag
//it has tow children head tag and body tag
//head tag and body tag are siblings
//title tag is the child of the head tag
//body tag has many children like h1, p,img tag
//these are also called as nodes
