        //this is how commenting is done in Javascript
        //Javascript is used to add functionality to the website and its also used to create games and animation
        //We always need html file to run javascript code as html createsa web page  on which JS comes.
        //Javascript can be used in 2 ways in HTML
        //Number1: internal javascript this means doing javascript coding inside the script tag
        //Number2: external javascript here seperate file is created with name.JS extension. That file connected to html using script tag
        //syntax :<script src="name.js">


            //1. Internal Javscript :

        //-------------Rules -------------â‚¹----------
        // 1) we put semi-colons (;) at the end of every js code. its like a fullstop.
        // 2) space is not an issue.
        // 3) Javascript is case sensitive : eg : if there is a function name which is in small letters then we have to give always in small letters we cannot give capital error will come. like in html we give tags in small letters or capital bith works.
        
        //-------------------------Differet or common functions--------------
        //1. print message on screen . this is like a p tag. messahe or text is always written in " "
        document.write ("Hello my name is Hana and my favorite animal is a bear");

        //2. to show notifier on screen
        window.alert("The file is downloaded")
