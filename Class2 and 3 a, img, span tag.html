<!--------Heading tags-------->
<!--Heading tags are those tags which are used to give only heading. So this helps us to give text which is bold and big. 
p tag gives text but it is not that big and bold. We have total 6 heading tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. All three gives
heading but h1 gives the biggest heading, followed by h2 which is smaller than h1, than h3, h4, h5 and h6 is the smallest 
in all heading-->

<h1>This is biggest heading in all 6</h1>
<h2>This is slighlty smaller than h1</h2>
<h3>This is slightly smaller than h2</h3>
<h4>This is slightly smaller than h3</h4>
<h5>This is slightly smaller than h4</h5>
<h6>This is slightly smaller than h5</h6>

<p>This is for normal text</p>
