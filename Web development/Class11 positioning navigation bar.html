    <!--1. margin: it is used to give space outside the box or button or if nothing normally we need
    to give space from left, right, bottom, top  to img, text, a tag etc.. we can use this
    To give space fromn all sides  use : margin:100px; space is always given in pixels.--
    if you want a space only from one side use according to that eg : if i want space from left side
    i will use margin-left:100px;
    and vice versa margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-right can be used
    -->

    <h1>Here we using margin</h1>

    <!--2. Padding : padding is also used to giev spacing but it works only if there is any border line which makes box eg : button tag, input tag where we enter text etc...--------------------------------Positioning-----------------
    if we want to gove space inside these borders then we use padding.
    for all sides space left, right, down, up : use padding :200px;
    for only one side space padding-left, padding-right, padding-down, padding-top.

    <button>Sign up</button>

    <!--3. position: absolute. this is also used to set position like margin.
    if you used margin and it did not gave space then use this. here it counts position from beginning of the screen and in margin it counts position from currect position 
   Here we use left, right, top, bottom.
    eg : if we have h2 tag and we appply margin-left to it then currently whereber our tag it moves left from there. 
    but if we apply position :absolute, left then counts from beginning of the screen
