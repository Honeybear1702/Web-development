<!------------------Notes---------------------------------
We will be learning to create website. for website we use some basic languages called as HTML, CSS, Javscript. 
HTML : hyper text mark up language. it creates a structure ina  website. Buttons, images, text, textbox and many more everything is with HTML.
CSS : cascading style sheet : whatever we created in HTML we need style to make it look better eg : background color, color, width, height etc that means without CSS our page will not look good
HTML and CSS together they have created a page. if CSS is missing then page will be boring.
JS : Javscript : So functionality is done with Javscript. that means  when we click on all the buttions or images nothing will work if we do not use the javascript so we have to use to make everything function


--------------------------------------Rules of HTML languages-
1. <> : tags. When we put anything inside these tags that becomes the name of the tag. if we give p inside <> it becomes p tag
eg : <p> p tag.
We cannot  put anything in tags. There are some specific things which we give in tags. These are all given by HTML. Lets say we need to craete a image  so for that we have 
<img> tag, we need to create text <p> tag, you want to go from one page to other there is <a> tag, for button we have <button> tag. So that
means we have tag for evrything  all we have to do is just use tags and remember them.

2. every tag has a opening tag and closing tag. It is just like () in math (BIDMAS) and (BODMAS).
eg : <p> opening tag
    here we put text
</p> closing tag

3. we can pass comments in HTML. this means writing small notes in simple english because program understands only HTML language so if we 
use simple english langauge error will come. So we can hide these simple english lines by putting it in

HTML 5 version we are using.

Every tag is in small letters. Although HTML is not case sensitive. We can also use capital
