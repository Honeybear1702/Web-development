<!---------------------------------------------Media Query
we have to make a website responsive that means adjusting our website according to the screen.
 If the the website is big it should become big but if the website is small it should become small. 
 In short it should fit according to the screen. But this doesnt happen automatically so that is
  why we use media query to adjust our website on all screens.-->
