<p>
    Hi my name is Hana and I am a girl.I am 10 years old and my birthday is on the 17th February.I am in year 6 and I have lots of classmates who are either 10 or 11.<br>
    My favourite food is Biryaani and my dad is very good at cooking. I have a sister,father and mother,including me there is 4 people in my family at home.<br>
    I really like bears and cats they are my favourite animals I also really like Roblox and Minecraft as they are really fun although I can't play Minecraft as it cost money so I am going to save up for it.<br>
    Also I really want a pet cat as they are very cute but my dad disagrees since he doesn't want any pets or animals in the house (which is why I am really upset).<br>
