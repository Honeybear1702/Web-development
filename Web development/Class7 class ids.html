<!--class is something where we give a name to the tags. e.g. : if we have two different tags but we want to do same styling to them then  we can give same classname to them.
and when styling is done we styling to that class and it gets applied to all who share same CSS. in short who different tags who have same style we can do their styling together.--. is used when we write name of class in CSS

-->
<!--in below situation, we want 2 images to have same style and third one to have different style. no if we directly write the name of the tag and do styling to it then it will have same style for all three.
 so another way is give one class name two images who have same style.
