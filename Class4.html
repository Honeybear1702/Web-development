<!--Table Tag is used to create a table which has rows and columns. table tag is used. Inside that we use tr tag which stands for table row
in firts row or tr tag we use th tag which is table head. Here we give all heading of every column. Let say we have three ncolumns we will use three
th tags and will give heading of every column. now we need to put things below these columns, that means we wil start will new tr tag  where we will use td tag 
whcih means table data this tag is used to give data in table. In short we use following tags

tr(table row),th(table head), td(table data / description)
th isn only used in first row means in first tr tag.
Later we use tr and td to put data.

Also to give lines around table give border in opening tag of table.
First tr means first row
second tr means second row and so on
 after first row we always use td tag in tr
